This app is currently live on Heroku [here](https://jamroom-client.herokuapp.com/).
Most functionality requires a Spotify account.
Songs can be searched/added to the queue with a Basic account, but playing the queue requires a Premium subscription.

Next steps for this app would be to add lobbies for multiple users to join to sync their playbacks together, or have one device hosted as the broadcast device.
